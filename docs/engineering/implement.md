## What it does

`implement` builds work that has already been decided. You point it at a [ticket](https://www.aihero.dev/ai-coding-dictionary/ticket), a [spec](https://www.aihero.dev/ai-coding-dictionary/spec), or the plan you just agreed in the conversation, and it writes the code, drives [tdd](https://aihero.dev/skills-tdd) at the seams, typechecks as it goes, runs [code-review](https://aihero.dev/skills-code-review) at the end, and stages only the changes made for that work.

It never reopens the plan. There is no interview, no clarifying round, no proposal of a different approach. Whatever was settled upstream is the input. That is what separates it from typing "build this" at a fresh [agent](https://www.aihero.dev/ai-coding-dictionary/agent), which often redesigns the work while it builds it.

## When to reach for it

You invoke this by typing `/implement` yourself, and the agent won't reach for it on its own. It ships with `disable-model-invocation: true`, so no other skill can call it either. Wherever [ask-matt](https://aihero.dev/skills-ask-matt) or [to-tickets](https://aihero.dev/skills-to-tickets) says "then `/implement` per ticket", that is an instruction to you, not something the agent will do unprompted.

Where the work currently lives decides whether this is the right skill:

| The work is… | Reach for |
| --- | --- |
| A ticket on the tracker | `/implement #42`, one ticket per [session](https://www.aihero.dev/ai-coding-dictionary/session), [clearing](https://www.aihero.dev/ai-coding-dictionary/clearing) context between tickets |
| A spec, not yet split up, and the build spans sessions | [to-tickets](https://aihero.dev/skills-to-tickets) first, then `/implement` per ticket |
| A spec, and the build is small | `/implement` directly against the spec |
| Only in the conversation you just had, and it's still small | `/implement` right there, in the same window |
| Not written down anywhere yet | [grill-with-docs](https://aihero.dev/skills-grill-with-docs), or [grill-me](https://aihero.dev/skills-grill-me) if there's no codebase |
| One concrete behaviour you want test-first, with no spec | [tdd](https://aihero.dev/skills-tdd) directly |
| Already built, and you want it checked | [code-review](https://aihero.dev/skills-code-review) directly |

The same-session case is worth naming because the skill's own first line doesn't cover it. `SKILL.md` says "the spec or tickets", which pushes the [model](https://www.aihero.dev/ai-coding-dictionary/model) to look for a file that doesn't exist. If the plan lives only in the thread, say so when you invoke it.

## Prerequisites

Check you are on the branch you want the work on before you start.

If the tickets came from [to-tickets](https://aihero.dev/skills-to-tickets), [setup-matt-pocock-skills](https://aihero.dev/skills-setup-matt-pocock-skills) configured the tracker they live on. `code-review` reads the same configuration to find the originating spec at close-out.

## What one run does

A run has five steps, in order:

1. Read the ticket or spec and work out the seams.
2. Drive [tdd](https://aihero.dev/skills-tdd) at the pre-agreed seams, one red-green slice at a time.
3. Typecheck often, run single test files as it goes.
4. Run the full test suite once, at the end.
5. Run [code-review](https://aihero.dev/skills-code-review), then stage the changes.

One run covers one ticket. The tickets [to-tickets](https://aihero.dev/skills-to-tickets) produces are tracer-bullet vertical slices sized to fit a single fresh [context window](https://www.aihero.dev/ai-coding-dictionary/context-window), so the intended rhythm is: clear context, implement one ticket, inspect and commit the staged changes yourself, clear again. Each ticket is self-contained, so you can discard the previous ticket's context.

## Pre-agreed seams

The skill's central idea is the **seam**, the public boundary you observe behaviour at without reaching inside. Tests live at seams. When the seam is agreed before any code exists, the tests last, and you can rewrite the implementation underneath without changing them.

The "pre-agreed" part matters, and it is also the skill's weakest point. Nothing inside `implement` agrees the seams. `tdd` is the skill that asks, and it refuses to write a test at an unconfirmed seam. So in practice the agreement happens either upstream in the spec, or in the first exchange of the run. If it happens nowhere, the run becomes "just write the code" and nothing warns you. Naming the seams in the spec is what stops that.

## Common questions

**It finished, but my ticket is still open and the acceptance criteria are still unchecked.**

Correct, and expected. `implement` ends with staged changes, not a closed ticket. It never updates the work item. This is the same on GitHub Issues and on the local markdown tracker, so it is not a tracker integration problem. It also does not act on the findings `code-review` produced, and does not tick the `- [ ]` boxes on the originating issue. Close the ticket and reconcile the criteria yourself. This matters most on a dependency chain, because `to-tickets` defines the frontier as tickets whose blockers are all closed. If nothing gets closed, nothing ever becomes visibly unblocked.

**Can I point it at all my tickets at once, or run several in parallel?**

Not with `/implement`: one invocation, one ticket. For a whole spec in one run, use [implement-spec](https://aihero.dev/skills-implement-spec), which gives each ticket on the ready frontier to a [subagent](https://www.aihero.dev/ai-coding-dictionary/subagent) in its own worktree, then merges the results onto one integration branch. Running several `/implement` sessions side by side in one checkout risks mixing their edits and staged changes: the sessions share one working directory and one index. Separate Git worktrees isolate those, but `refs/stash` is still shared across worktrees.

**Does it commit or open a pull request?**

Neither is built in. It leaves the changes staged so you can inspect them, then commit and open a pull request when ready. When the agent does write the PR, [pr](https://aihero.dev/skills-pr) shapes its body.

**`code-review` says it cannot see my changes.**

`code-review` reviews `git diff <fixed-point>...HEAD`, which excludes staged and working-tree changes. The review inside `implement` therefore cannot see its uncommitted changes, and staging them does not resolve this existing limitation. To include them with the current `code-review` skill, commit them yourself when ready, then rerun the review against the point you branched from.

Separately, some people do not want the review inside the run at all, because an agent reviewing the code it just wrote is biased toward its own solution. Running [code-review](https://aihero.dev/skills-code-review) in a fresh session against a fixed point is a valid alternative. The same bias is why that skill runs its two axes in separate sub-agents.

**One ticket burned 150k tokens. Am I using it wrong?**

Probably not. The ticket is more likely too big. A run does codebase exploration, a red-green loop per seam, a full suite, and a review, so a non-trivial ticket exceeding 100k [tokens](https://www.aihero.dev/ai-coding-dictionary/token) is normal rather than a sign something broke. The fix is upstream. Right-size the tickets in [to-tickets](https://aihero.dev/skills-to-tickets) so each fits one fresh window. If a single ticket keeps going over, split it rather than raising the [effort](https://www.aihero.dev/ai-coding-dictionary/effort) level.

**`/implement #2` in a fresh session worked on something completely unrelated.**

The agent resolves `#2` against whatever numbered list it can see. In a fresh session that may be a todo file, a checklist, or another work list rather than the configured tracker. The agent does not stop when the match is uncertain, so the mistake is not obvious until the work has started. Pass the full reference, the issue URL or `owner/repo#2`, and ask it to confirm the title back before it begins.

## It's working if

- The session opens by reading the ticket or spec and restating what it will build, rather than asking you what to build.
- You can see an actual `/tdd` invocation in the trace, not just tests appearing in the diff.
- Typechecks and single test files run repeatedly during the run, and the full suite runs once near the end.
- The run leaves its changes staged without creating a commit or staging unrelated changes.
- The diff is one ticket's worth of change: a vertical slice through every layer, not several tickets swept together.

## Where it fits

`implement` is the build step of the main chain:

```txt
grill-with-docs → to-spec → to-tickets → implement → code-review → retro
```

Its neighbours are [to-tickets](https://aihero.dev/skills-to-tickets), which produces the tickets it consumes and declares the blocking edges that decide their order; [tdd](https://aihero.dev/skills-tdd), which it drives internally at each seam; and [code-review](https://aihero.dev/skills-code-review). It sits downstream of the planning skills and trusts them. It does not re-validate the shape of what it was handed, so a badly-structured map or a horizontally-layered ticket gets built as written.

That trust is why [wayfinder](https://aihero.dev/skills-wayfinder) merges onto the chain at [to-spec](https://aihero.dev/skills-to-spec) rather than looping its map straight into `implement`. Go straight to `implement` from a map only when the effort turned out small.

[ask-matt](https://aihero.dev/skills-ask-matt) is the router over the whole set when you are not sure which flow you are in.
